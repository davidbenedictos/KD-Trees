# Binary KD-Trees

### Introduction
***
This README provides an overview and basic guide for understanding and using the implementation of **k-dimensional binary trees (k-d trees)**. 
K-d trees are data structures used to organize k-dimensional points in a multidimensional space to facilitate efficient operations such as search and retrieval. In this project, we have implemented standard k-d trees along with procedures to create them empty, insert k-dimensional keys, and destroy them once all necessary searches are completed.

### Files
***
The project consists of one _.cc_ and one _.hh_: file:
- **kdtree.hh**: This file contains the declaration of the KDTree class, which represents the k-dimensional tree and defines its methods.
- **kdtree.cc**: This file contains the implementation of the methods of the KDTree class.
